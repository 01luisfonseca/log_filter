2019-07-16 06:00:00 - Launch preparations begin at the Kennedy Space Center. Technical teams perform final checks on the Apollo 11 spacecraft and Saturn V rocket.
2019-07-16 08:32:00 - Successful launch of the Saturn V rocket from Launch Pad 39A. The three F-1 engines of the first stage generate 7.5 million pounds of thrust, propelling the vehicle to an initial speed of 6,164 mph (9,920 km/h)
2019-07-16 08:32:42 - At an altitude of 67 km, the first stage of the rocket separates and falls into the Atlantic Ocean. The J-2 engines of the second stage ignite, providing the propulsion needed for the next phase of the flight.
2019-07-16 08:48:23 - After 2 minutes and 43 seconds of second stage burn, the Apollo 11 spacecraft is successfully inserted into a low Earth orbit at an altitude of 185 km. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins perform tests and checks on board.
2019-07-16 12:22:00 - After one complete orbit around the Earth, the J-2 engines of the third stage are ignited for 5 minutes and 48 seconds. This propellant burn sends the Apollo 11 spacecraft on a trajectory towards the Moon.
2019-07-16 15:30:00 - Following the separation of the command and service module from the Saturn V rocket, the astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins perform a series of maneuvers and adjustments to prepare the spacecraft for lunar orbit insertion.
2019-07-16 15:34:00 - Using the service module engines, the Apollo 11 spacecraft successfully enters lunar orbit at an altitude of 100 km above the lunar surface. The astronauts take measurements and observations of the Moon during several orbital revolutions.
2019-07-20 12:51:00 - After the separation of the "Eagle" lunar module from the command module, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong begin the lunar landing in the Mare Tranquilitatis. The lunar module touches down softly on the lunar surface, successfully completing the landing.
2019-07-20 12:53:15 - Neil Armstrong becomes the first human to step onto the lunar surface, uttering the iconic words: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." Buzz Aldrin follows shortly after.
2019-07-20 23:11:00 - During 2 hours and 20 minutes, Armstrong and Aldrin collect 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of rock and soil samples, which will be later analyzed on Earth.
2019-07-21 02:41:00 - After completing all the planned activities on the lunar surface, Armstrong and Aldrin return to the lunar module, dock, and lift off from the Moon.
2019-07-21 16:35:00 - Following the separation of the lunar module, the command and service module successfully docks with the command module, completing the reunification of the Apollo 11 spacecraft.
2019-07-22 04:28:00 - After performing the re-entry maneuvers, the command module separates from the service module and enters the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 24,000 mph (38,600 km/h).
2019-07-24 16:50:00 - The command module successfully splashes down in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 900 miles (1,450 km) southwest of Hawaii.
2019-07-24 16:55:00 - The three astronauts are safely recovered by the USS Hornet recovery ship, marking the successful completion of the historic Apollo 11 mission.
